"""
The New Track Check QC module provides the functions needed to perform the
track check. The main routine is mds_full_track_check which takes a
list of class`.MarineReport` from a single ship and runs the track check on them.
This is an update of the MDS system track check in that it assumes the Earth is a
sphere. In practice it gives similar results to the cylindrical earth formerly
assumed.
