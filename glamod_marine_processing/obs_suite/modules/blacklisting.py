    """
    Do basic blacklisting on the report. The blacklist is used to remove data that are known to be bad
    and shouldn't be passed to the QC.

    If the report is from Deck 732, compares the observations year and location to a table of pre-identified
    regions in which Deck 732 observations are known to be dubious - see Rayner et al. 2006 and Kennedy et al.
    2011b. Observations at 0 degrees latitude 0 degrees longitude are blacklisted as this is a common error.
    C-MAN stations with platform type 13 are blacklisted. SEAS data from deck 874 are unreliable (SSTs were
    often in excess of 50degC) and so the whole deck was removed from processing.

    Parameters
    ----------
    id : str
        ID of the report
    deck : int
        Deck of the report
    year : int
        Year of the report

    latitude: float
        Latitude of the report
    longitude : float

    platform_type : int
